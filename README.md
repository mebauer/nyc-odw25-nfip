# 1. Introduction

What can we learn about NYC's flood risk and flood insurance claims from FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) data? How can combining NFIP claims data with datasets like 311 street flooding complaints uncover new insights?

Join Mark Bauer and Tiffany Cousins, two civic-minded data enthusiasts, to explore key trends and relationships in FEMA’s NFIP redacted claims data for NYC, investigating how these trends align with broader flood risk and urban dynamics. We aim to answer the following questions:
- How can we analyze trends in the number and amount of NFIP claims over time?
- What are the most costly flood events, and how do they impact flood risk management?
- How can we map the geographic distribution of claims, while being mindful of the limitations with redacted data?
- What can we learn by integrating NFIP claims data with NYC’s 311 street flooding complaints to identify areas of vulnerability?

The ultimate goal is to equip participants with the skills to use Python, SQL, and DuckDB for analyzing NFIP data, while also providing a deep understanding of NYC's flood risk.

The primary takeaway is how insights from FEMA’s NFIP claims data can drive urban policy decisions, improve flood risk management, and help stakeholders make data-driven choices.

Who should attend? This session is designed for individuals with beginner-level proficiency in data analysis, as well as those interested in flood insurance and urban flood risk. Prior experience with the following will be helpful but is not required:
- Interest in FEMA NFIP data and the OpenFEMA API
- Learning about urban flood risk and data-driven risk analysis
- Basic Python or SQL programming and working with geospatial data

| Dataset | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| [OpenFEMA Dataset: FIMA NFIP Redacted Claims - v2](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-claims-v2) | Congress passed the National Flood Insurance Act (NFIA), 42 U.S.C. 4001 in 1968, creating the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in order to reduce future flood losses through flood hazard identification, floodplain management, and providing insurance protection. This dataset provides details on NFIP claims transactions. It is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information. |

# 4. Open Source Applications Used in Project 

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): A distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment.  
- [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html): Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project, born out of the IPython Project in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages.  
    - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try): The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
